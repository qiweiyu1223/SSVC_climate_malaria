# Content:
 - 1 codes: there are two codes in the file. One is the code for the global variable's definition, and the other is the detailed code for all the regression analysis. 

 - 2 figures: all dofile (Stata) for the all figures shown in the main paper and Supplementary Appendix (except for some figures created by ArcGIS or QGIS).
 - 3 data: due to the limit size of upload in the Github, we provide the DHS dataset used in this study through Google Drive:
    - household.dta (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QD2tPTvwOK9fGt04-jzFPCOCn1EJWZ8c/view?usp=drive_link)
